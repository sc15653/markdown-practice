#  My Favorite Hobby

Cooking is my favorite hobby and Nigerian jollof rice is the dish I enjoy making the most. I can eat it: hot or cold, in the morning, afternoon or evening. It is bold, colorful, rich with spices, and always reminds me of home.

**What Makes Jollof Special? You make ask**

Jollof rice is made by simmering long grain rice in a blended mixture of tomatoes, peppers, onions, spices and stock. The flavor develops slowly and every spoonful tastes smoky, spicy and deeply savory. Not only this, it is the first dish my mum taught me to make. Till this day i still teach my friends and siblings how to prepare it exactly like her.

**Why I Enjoy Cooking Jollof**

I love how the ingredients come together in one pot, and fill the kitchen with a warm aroma as the rice cooks. Besides this, what i love the most is how it's served. I eat mine with grilled assorted meats and a chilled juice to balance the mood.


**Again, more info about Duess and her love for jollof:**
